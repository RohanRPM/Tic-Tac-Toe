How to Play
Each player is assigned either "R" or "Nyes".
Click on an empty box to place your marker ("R" or "Nyes").
The game will automatically switch turns after each move.
The game ends when a player has three markers in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
If all boxes are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is declared a tie.
